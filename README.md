## Usage
# Quick Start
Run the main analysis script:
bashpython main.py
What the Script Does
This will automatically:

# Download Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) stock data and save to data/ folder
Compute daily returns and rolling averages (30-day default)
Perform statistical analysis comparing both stocks
Generate comprehensive visualizations
Save all plots and results to the results/ folder

# Running Jupyter Notebooks
For interactive exploration:
bashjupyter notebook notebooks/
Dependencies

# Python 3.12+
pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
numpy - Numerical computing
matplotlib - Plotting library
seaborn - Statistical data visualization
yfinance - Yahoo Finance API wrapper
scikit-learn - Machine learning utilities
statsmodels - Statistical modeling
jupyter - Interactive notebook environment

# Sample Output
The project generates several types of visualizations:
Generated Plots

# Closing Prices Over Time - Historical stock price trends
30-Day Rolling Average - Smoothed price movements
Returns Distribution - Statistical distribution of daily returns
Correlation Analysis - Relationship between AAPL and TSLA
Volatility Comparison - Risk assessment charts

All plots are automatically saved in the results/ folder as high-resolution PNG files.
Data Output

Raw stock data: data/aapl_data.csv, data/tsla_data.csv
Analysis results: results/analysis_summary.csv
Statistical metrics: results/performance_metrics.csv

# Configuration
You can modify the analysis parameters by editing main.py:
python# Example configuration options
START_DATE = '2020-01-01'  # Analysis start date
END_DATE = '2023-12-31'    # Analysis end date
ROLLING_WINDOW = 30        # Rolling average window (days)
Example Results
Here's what you can expect from the analysis:
